# ADR-001: Use TypeScript for type safety

- **Status**: accepted
- **Date**: 2025-01-15
- **Supersedes**: (none)
- **Superseded by**: (none)

## Context

The example system needed to choose a language/type system for implementation. The team wanted to ensure type safety while maintaining reasonable developer ergonomics.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Plain JavaScript

Description: Use JavaScript without static typing.

**Pros:**
- Simple setup, no build step required
- Familiar to all developers
- Faster iteration time

**Cons:**
- No static type checking
- Error detection happens at runtime
- IDE support is limited

### Option 2: TypeScript

Description: Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled.

**Pros:**
- Strong static type checking catches errors early
- Excellent IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code through types

**Cons:**
- Adds compilation step
- Requires build infrastructure
- Learning curve for TypeScript idioms

## Decision

We chose TypeScript because the benefits of static type checking outweigh the additional complexity for this system. The early error detection and IDE support improve developer experience significantly.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fewer runtime errors in production
- Better developer experience with IDE autocompletion
- Clear API contracts through type definitions

### Negative
- Build step required before deployment
- Team needs TypeScript expertise

### Neutral
- TypeScript files need to be transpiled to JavaScript
- Additional tooling and dependencies required
